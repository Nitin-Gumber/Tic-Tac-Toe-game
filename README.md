# Tic Tac Toe Game Project

I have created a **Tic Tac Toe game** using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Description

This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game featuring a sleek and responsive design, thanks to Tailwind CSS. It offers an enjoyable and intuitive user experience, perfect for both casual players and those looking to practice their strategic thinking!

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Seamless play on any device, be it desktop or mobile.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and straightforward user interface.
- **Interactive Controls**: Easy-to-use game controls for a smooth gaming experience.
- **Game Logic**: Implements core Tic Tac Toe game mechanics, including win detection and draw conditions.

## How to Build the Game Logic

1. **Initialize the Game Board**:
   - Create a 3x3 grid using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
   - Use JavaScript to represent the board state as an array.

2. **Handle Player Moves**:
   - Add event listeners to each cell to handle clicks.
   - Update the board state array and the UI accordingly.

3. **Check for Win Conditions**:
   - After each move, check rows, columns, and diagonals for a winning combination.
   - Declare the winner if a player has three in a row.

4. **Check for Draw Conditions**:
   - If all cells are filled and no player has won, declare a draw.

5. **Reset the Game**:
   - Provide a button to reset the board and start a new game.
